# Django Training Apps

I have create a min project with several apps that demonstrate simple CRUD.

1. Todo App
* This app can be used as a notepad for reminders. You can create a list of TODO, mark it completed, delete one by one or delete all.

2. User App
* In this app, you can create user credentials that will be used in other app. 

3. Blog App
* After creating credential in User app, you can create blog, prefo search and delete. 

4. Store App
