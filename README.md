# Django Portfolio

I have create a single project with several apps that demonstrate simple CRUD in Django.

1. Todo App
* This app can be used as a notepad for your reminders. You can create a list of TODO, mark it completed, delete it one by one or delete it all.

2. User App
* In this app, you can create user credentials that will be used in other app. 

3. Blog App
* After creating credential in User app, you can create an blog, search and delete. 

4. Store App
* This work as ecommerce. I will update this soon. 

5. Index App
* This is my profile. I will update this soon. 


# Run
I did not apply any gitignore in this project.
